# MetalDemo_Swift
Rewrite Apple's demos of Metal in Swift🌏

## Why I write this?

If you are a beginner of metal you may look up the demos below:



1、[Devices and Commands](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/devices_and_commands) 

2、[Hello Trangle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/hello_triangle)

3、[Basic Buffers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/fundamental_lessons/basic_buffers)

4、[Basic Texturing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/fundamental_lessons/basic_texturing)

5、[Hello Compute](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/compute_processing/hello_compute)


Apparently apple write their demos in Objective-c, if you want to write it in swift, it's not that convenient in the beginning.
So I rewrite Apple's demo projects in swift. I hope it'll help you.
